Module 3: Iterables and Conditional Statement

• Definitions

• Sequences

• Unpacking Sequences

• Dictionaries

• The len() function

• Sets

• Conditional Statements

• Loops in Python

• break and continue

• enumerate

• Generators

• List Comprehensions

• Advanced List Comprhensions

• Collections Module

• Mapping and Filtering

• Mutable and Immutable Buitilin Objects

• Sorting

• Unpacking Sequences in Function Calls

• Labs:

• Unpack a tuple into variables and print their values.

• Write a program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero.

• Write a program to print each character of a string along with its index.

• Generate a list of squares of even numbers between 1 and 20.

• Use Counter from the collections module to count occurrences of each element in a list.



Sequences

tuple

list

string



Unpacking Sequences

used to extract the data from the list or the tuple to the variable and use it



dictionary



###### enumerate()

The enumerate() function is used to loop over a sequence (like list, tuple, string, etc.) and get both:

1. Index (position)
2. Value (element)



enumerate(iterable, start=0)





###### List Comprehensions



\[expression for item in iterable if condition]



###### Collections Module

The collections module in Python provides specialized container data types as alternatives to built-in ones like list, dict, tuple, and set.

| Type        | Purpose                          |

| ----------- | -------------------------------- |

| Counter     | Frequency counting               |

| defaultdict | Default value for missing keys   |

| OrderedDict | Maintains order (extra features) |

| deque       | Fast queue/stack                 |

| namedtuple  | Tuple with named fields          |

| ChainMap    | Combine dictionaries             |

	Install Python, set up an IDE, and run a basic Python program to print "Hello, Python!" 
	Declare variables of various data types (int, float, str, list, dict). Print their types and values. 
	Create a list of numbers, calculate their sum, and find the maximum and minimum values. 
	Write a program that asks for the user's name and age, then prints a message: "Hello, [name]! You are [age] years old."
